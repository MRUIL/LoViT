# LoViT
This work is proposed for online surgical phase recognition task, and the full code is not available now because of the patent and review process. But the extracted features and trained spatial feature extractor weight on Cholec80 and AutoLaparo are available now.

The core code of getting transition map is also available.

## The trained weight
The trained temporally-rich spatial feature extractor weight and the extracted features on Cholec80 and AutoLapro are available at: [OneDrive Link](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/k21073807_kcl_ac_uk/EpShcwpjssRGomJdcEhfZ68B6bNAt_WAVKfOrtrUfI-Bgw?e=YPJNpf).

## How to use the trained weight
```
def extracted_spatial_feature(video, TIMM):
  '''
  video shape: B, C, len, h, w #Note that the features are extracted separately
  '''
  feats = TIMM(video_gpu) #B, 768, len, 1, 1
  
TIMM = torch.load('Trained_VIT_Cholec80.pth') # Should have the `models' folder that saves the class, timm version: 0.4.12
```
## How to use the extracted features directly
```
with open(f"DATA/Cholec80/{video_indx}.pkl", 'rb') as f:
  feature= torch.tensor(pickle.load(f)) # 768, len, 1, 1
```
